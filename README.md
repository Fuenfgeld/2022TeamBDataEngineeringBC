This is a repository for a Data Engineering Tutorial.
This repository contains the data, code and presentations to teach our fellow students, or other people who are interested in SQLite about the basics of SQLite. The main part is the transformation of an unknown table sctructure into a star schema. 

This workbook will teach you three main goals:
* You will learn how to use PRAGMA-functions to create an ER-diagram out of the meta-information of a database
* You will learn how to do small queries with SELECT and sub-SELECTs. Additioanlly you'll learn the differences between OLTP and OLAP databases.
* You will learn about star schemes and how to transform your database structure into a star scheme.

Please read through the explainations in our workbook and transfer the acquired knowledge to our given exercises. After the exercise you'll be able to confirm if you solved the problems correctly.

The workbook about our SQLite lesson can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/2022TeamBDataEngineeringBC/blob/main/Presentation/Pr%C3%A4sentation%20SQLite.ipynb).


If you only want to do the exercises and skip our explainations you can find the exercises here:
* [Part 1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/2022TeamBDataEngineeringBC/blob/main/Uebungen/Uebungen/Uebungen%20zu%20Teil%201.ipynb)
* [Part 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/2022TeamBDataEngineeringBC/blob/main/Uebungen/Uebungen/Uebungen%20zu%20Teil%202.ipynb)
* [Part 3](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/2022TeamBDataEngineeringBC/blob/main/Uebungen/Uebungen/Uebungen%20zu%20Teil%203.ipynb)

The solutions are linked at the end of the exercise.
